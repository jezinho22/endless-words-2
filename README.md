# Endless Words

A word strategy game for two (at the moment). Corner your opponent, bluff them, surprise them, challenge them, using your word and spelling knowledge.

## How to play
Add letters turn by turn to a string of letters without finishing a word. If you can force your opponent to finish a word, then you win the round.  
Of course you could just add letters randomly, but the other rule is that you must have a word in mind when you add a letter.  

### Challenge buttons
You win by successfully challenging your opponent.

**Word Completed:** *Use this button if you have forced your opponent to finish a word on their turn. If you are right, you win the round*  

**No word:** *Use this button if you don't believe your opponent has a word in mind that can be made with the letter they added. It will ask them to input the word they were thinking of - if it is not a word, then you were right and you win the round. But maybe they had a word you hadn't thought of - and then you lose the round.*  

For instance:
1. o
2. ol
3. ole
4. tole
Ha! Think they have me cornered? (stole) I don't think so!
5. tolen
What?!? Now they have cornered _me_! (stolen) Do I make the word or bluff that I have a word? Bluff!
6. tolent
Could be a word. If it is I could just add -ly on the end, maybe. But maybe it's a bluff. I think it's a bluff
7. Challenge: No word
